			<p class="hacker-text">I made an N-way superscalar OoO processor based on MIPS R10K architecture. It also supported early branch resolution to improve processor performance and was implemented in SystemVerilog. I learned a lot about synthesizing hardware, creating testbenches, and verifying the correctness of the hardware.</p>

			<pre><p class="hacker-text">Self-Driving Robot		Fall 2019</p></pre>
			<p class="hacker-text">I made a self-driving robot using an FPGA board. The robot used sensors and motors to move and its goal was to drive around indefinitely as long as its path wasnâ€™t obstructed. This was done in Verilog and I learned how to use wave simulation test benches during this project. </p>
